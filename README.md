## Database Schema
The database schema consists of 8 tables representing different entities in an Instagram-like application, such as users, posts, comments, likes, and followers. The schema design ensures proper relationships between the tables using primary and foreign keys.
## SQL Scripts
The SQL scripts directory contains various scripts for creating the database schema, tables, and constraints. It also includes scripts for populating initial data if required. The scripts are organized as follows:
- `create_tables.sql`: Creates the tables with their columns and constraints with initial data.
For more details, refer to the [SQL scripts](./sql_scripts/) directory.
